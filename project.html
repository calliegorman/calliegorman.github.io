    <h3>For every problem, there is a solution</h3>
    <p>Problem: How could I design a cloud storage solution that would be a compelling alternative to popular competitors such as Google Drive and DropBox?</p>
    <p>Solution: An easy to use desktop and mobile application for people wanting to save and collaborate on content. The application features an intuitive and visually appealing interface, a series of collaboration options, and dashboard personalization.</p>

  <section class="competition">
    <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
    <p>The cloud storage market is filled with top notch competition: Google Drive, DropBox, Box, and more. The challenge was to create a new tool that could stand up to the competition. There were four potential opportunities for connected based off of where the competition seemingly fell flat:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Produce a different and more inspiring design for connected’s dashboard.</li>
      <li>Focus on branding toward the individual user vs businesses.</li>
      <li>Provide users with different ways to acquire more storage space other than paying for it.</li>
      <li>Create a personality that exudes a tone of voice that is friendly and has a sense of humor.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>
  <section class="user research">
    <h3>User Research</h3>
    <p>Next, I conducted user research to find out what users really needed and wanted to work their best. Testing early on in the process, and ensuring a subset of the respondents were users of the competition, allowed me to position connected in a way that directly resolved major pain points.</p>
    <p>Users think things could be improved, such as…
      <ul>
        <li>Even more free storage space</li>
        <li>Real time notifications on doc collaborations</li>
        <li>Visual interface</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Users use their tool of choice because of…
      <ul>
        <li>Amount of free storage</li>
        <li>Collaboration tools available</li>
        <li>Ease of use</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Overall, there were no clear trends in the data that suggested users were entirely unhappy with their current tool. My challenge was to then focus on important points respondents made in the survey, and build a product that met those needs in addition to what the market was lacking.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="personas">
    <h3>User Persona</h3>
    <p>Given the similarity in many responses across survey questions, it made sense to create one broad user persona to highlight the pain points and goals for the potential users.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Nathan, 28 yo</li>
      <li>Small Business Owner in Boston, MA</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Goals</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Real time notifications on collaborations</li>
      <li>Simple interface</li>
      <li>Easy way to organize photos</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Frustrations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Cannot always identify who is editing his documents</li>
      <li>Hard to find old documents</li>
      <li>Needs more storage</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="stories">
    <h3>Stories</h3>
    <p>Because connected would be a minimum viable product, I included functionality that met all of the high and some medium priority tasks within the user stories to prioritize items in the tool for the landing page, sign up/login pop ups, dashboard, and the in dashboard document.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="flows">
    <h3>Flows</h3>
    <p>User flows were then created for each high priority task to ensure that the mockups included each needed process.</p>

  </section>
  <section class="wireframes">
    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
    <p>Next, I sketched low fidelity wireframes to match each user flow, and transferred those sketches into myBalsamiq. Usability tests were conducted on these wireframes, which helped identify items needing change early on. Some of these items included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Combining “upload an item” icon and “add new” icon</li>
      <li>Creating left-hand side navigation</li>
      <li>Taking out option to sign up through Facebook, as all users said they would (and did in the test) use email </li>
    </ul>

  <section class="mind mapping">
    <h3>Mind Mapping & List Making</h3>
    <p>Two of the most important items for connected’s brand identity was personality and simplicity. The company was meant to be approachable and have a casual, fun tone of voice. The point of portraying these characteristics was to jump on the opportunity in the market that the competitors had missed - to focus on the user’s individuality.</p>

The point of portraying these characteristics was to jump on the opportunity in the market that the competitors had missed - to focus on the user’s individuality.
      I iterated on these ideas through mind mapping and listmaking.  Soon after, the headline for connected came together in my mind to cover all users needs:</p>
      <p class= "connected motto">connected
        to others, your unique way of working,
        and the world of data around you.</p>
      </section>
  <section class="logo">
    <h3>Logo Development</h3>
    <p>While developing the logo, I thought about startup culture, and about the casual nature of using all lowercase letters and abbreviations. After several sketches, I settled on a box-like look featuring 4 letters “c” “n” “t” “d” for connected.</p>
    <p>There were several more iterations once I got into Sketch.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="mockups">
    <h3>High Fidelity Mockups</h3>
    <p>With wireframing complete, I began producing high fidelity wireframes. During this process, I came across something of a branding identity crisis, first having settled on one logo/color palette and realizing myself (and with feedback from others) that the look was not working or matching what the brand was supposed to be all about.</p>

  </section>
  <section class="usability tests">
    <h3>Usability Tests</h3>
    <p>I conducted three usability tests after completing my prototype to ensure that the site was easy to navigate. I asked users to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sign up for an account on the homepage</li>
      <li>Log into the account from the homepage</li>
      <li>Add a new document in the dashboard</li>
      <li>Share a file with someone</li>
      <li>Tell me what they thought all of the icons in the dashboard represented</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Two issues needed to be addressed in the redesign:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The login dropdown process was the only one that differentiated from the usual modal pop up and confused users.</li>
      <li>There were sometimes too many click throughs on actions taken in the dashboard to get to the desired outcome. I took these two items into consideration and made updates.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="preference tests">
    <h3>Preference Tests</h3>
    <p>There were a few other items specifically related to visual design that I was compelled to update after preference testing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Decreasing the size of icons on the dashboard</li>
      <li>Ensuring most of the background image on the dashboard screen was hidden in order to make content stand out</li>
      <li>Updating the section headers on the landing page from dark gray to blue</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="conclusion">
    <h1>CONCLUSION</h1></section>
    <section class="takeaways">
      <h3>Takeaways</h3>
      <p>In the end, connected succeeded in being an intuitive cloud storage product with unique branding personality. Users were able to easily navigate the website during late user testing, and appreciated the personalization of the dashboard. </p>
      <p>User testing was crucial in this project. Watching how users navigated the site proved invaluable and compelled me to make several changes to the user experience and also visual design of the site.
          </p>
      <p>This process forced me to grow as a designer. After thinking I had an almost finished product in the branding stage, I scrapped the idea and followed the path that was more aligned with the branding identity through user testing and designer feedback.
